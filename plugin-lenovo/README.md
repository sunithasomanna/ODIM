# Lenovo plugin

Lenovo plugin communicates with Redfish-compliant Lenovo BMCs. This is an independent module which provides two primary communication channels:  

- API mechanism used to exchange control data
- Event Message Bus (EMB) used to exchange event and notifications

For guidelines on developing API and EMB functions to work within the Resource Aggregator for ODIM environment, see the *[Redfish Plugin Developer's Readme](https://github.com/ODIM-Project/ODIM/blob/development/plugin-redfish/README.md)*.
